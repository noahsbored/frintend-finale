the whole meat of the project is using axios to pull info from the backend, we use routes, as well as useparam to allow us to use the enpoints as a paramter. we use a lot of async functins to make sure the logic happens  asynchronously. we use event handlers to manage the state of the forms. a lot goes into this but essentially its basically just taking info from the flask database and using axios to do the crud operations.
